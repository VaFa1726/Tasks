🎬 Movie Roulette is a Django project for managing watched and unwatched movies. Users can:

➕ Add movies and mark them as watched or unwatched.

🎲 Watch movies randomly from their personal collection.

🌐 Fetch random movies from the internet and display them.

This project is ideal for users who want a personal movie list and want to make movie-night decisions easier.
It also serves as a Django project showcase demonstrating practical skills in backend
development, API integration, and random data handling.
